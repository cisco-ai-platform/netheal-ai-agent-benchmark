# Examples

Run the included examples:

```bash
# Basic usage demonstration
python examples/basic_usage.py

# Interactive console demo
python examples/interactive_demo.py
```

What they show:
- `basic_usage.py`: reset → act → step loop; prints rewards and renders text state.
- `interactive_demo.py`: safer access patterns for `info['action_result']` and dict observations.
